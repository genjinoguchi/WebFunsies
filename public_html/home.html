			Most times, when I meet someone for the first time, they do something like:</center><br>
			<font size="30" face="arial black" color="white">NO WAY<br>YOU'RE JAPANESE???<br>
			I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOU!</font>
			<br>
			...<br></p>
			<br>
			<p><font color="White" align="left">Turns out, however, that I'm not all Japanese.<br>
			Just half.<br>
			Sorry to disappoint.<br></font>
			Here's my family:
			<ul>
				<li>The one that holds up our family- my dad, Kazuo.<br>
				He's the one that is supporting all of us,<br>
				you can tell that I'm pretty grateful for him.<br>

				<br>Thanks dad.</li>
				<li>Next is mom, who is Taiwanese (NOT CHINESE, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE).<br>
				She works hard and puts all of us before herself.<br>
				What a great mom.<nr>
				You're the best.<br>
				Without her, i would never find anything at home haha.</li>
			</ul>
