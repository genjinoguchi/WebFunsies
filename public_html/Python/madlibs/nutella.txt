 NAME NAME1, who owned a NOUN in NAME, in the NAME district of NAME, an area known for the VERBing of NOUNs, VERBed an initial NOUN of 300 NOUNs (660 lb) of "NAME" in 1946. This was ADVERB a ADJECTIVE block, but NAME1 started to VERB a ADJECTIVE version in 1951 as "NAME2".
In 1963, NAME1's son NAME NAME1 revamped NAME2 with the intention of marketing it across Europe. Its composition was VERBed and it was renamed "NAME3". The first jar of NAME3 VERBed the NAME1 factory in Alba on 20 April 1964. The product was an instant success and remains ADVERB ADJECTIVE.  In France, senator NAME proposed a NOUN2 increase on NOUN1 from 100 to 400 per NOUN. At 20%, NOUN1 is one of NAME3's main ingredients and the NOUN2 was dubbed "the NAME3 tax" in the media.
World NAME3 Day is February 5th.
