to VERB, or not to VERB-- that is the NOUN:
Whether 'tis nobler in the NOUN to VERB
The NOUNs and NOUNs of ADJECTIVE fortune
Or to take NOUNs against a sea of NOUNs
And by opposing end them.  To VERB, to VERB--
No more--and by a VERB to say we end
The Heartache, and the thousand ADJECTIVE VERB
That flesh is heir to.
